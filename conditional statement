Conditional Statements:

if: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
else: Executes a block of code if the if condition is false.
else if: Allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.
switch: Executes one of several possible code blocks based on the value of a variable or expression.
Looping Statements:

for-in: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., an array, range, string, dictionary) and executes a block of code for each element.
while: Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. The condition is checked before each execution.
repeat-while: Similar to while, but the condition is checked after each execution, guaranteeing that the block of code is executed at least once.
Control Transfer Statements:

break: Terminates the execution of a loop or switch statement.
continue: Skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and starts the next iteration.
fallthrough: (Used in switch statements) Causes execution to continue to the next case in the switch statement, even if the case's value doesn't match. (Note: this is different from the behavior in C/C++/Java, where break is required at the end of each case).
return: Exits a function and returns a value (if the function has a return type).
throw: Used for error handling; throws an error that can be caught and handled by a catch block.

}

    print("It's a hot day!")
} else if temperature > 15 {
    print("It's a pleasant day.")
} else {
    print("It's a bit chilly.")
}

let dayOfWeek = "Tuesday"

    print("It's Tuesday.")
case "Wednesday":
    print("It's Hump Day!")
case "Thursday":
    print("Almost Friday!")
case "Friday":
    print("TGIF!")
default:
    print("It's the weekend!")
}

let score = 85

switch score {
case 0..<60:
    print("Fail")
case 60..<70:
    print("Pass")
case 70..<80:
    print("Good")
case 80..<90:
    print("Very Good")
case 90...100: // Note the ... for closed range (inclusive)
    print("Excellent")
default:
    print("Invalid score")
}
